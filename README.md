yeah, the name is fucking horrendous, but I haven't thought of a better one, so I'll change it later

the gui and design and shit so far cause I don't have much experience in swing, so I just tried to replicate messenger's design

my friend has an idea for the looks though, so I'll work on that later

the app overall is very bare bones, you can only add friends, create chats and send messages to those chats but ofc I'll add more things later on

I'll write down the roadmap here so I won't forget

- massive redesign
- add profile pictures
- overall add sending images and support for opening shit like images and videos in the app
- add markdown support maybe idk
- make an android client (haven't ever done anything in android so this might take a while)
- uhhhhhh ummmmmmmmmm
