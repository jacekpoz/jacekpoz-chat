~~yeah, the name is fucking horrendous, but I haven't thought of a better one, so I'll change it later~~

~~the gui and design and shit so far cause I don't have much experience in swing, so I just tried to replicate messenger's design~~

~~my friend has an idea for the looks though, so I'll work on that later~~

~~the app overall is very bare bones, you can only add friends, create chats and send messages to those chats but ofc I'll add more things later on~~

~~I'll write down the roadmap here so I won't forget~~

~~- massive redesign (by redesign I mean the ui)~~
~~- add profile pictures~~
~~- overall add sending images and support for opening shit like images and videos in the app~~
~~- add markdown support maybe idk~~
~~- make an android client (haven't ever done anything in android so this might take a while)~~
~~- uhhhhhh ummmmmmmmmm~~

this is the old version of the xnor chat, which is now split into multiple repos:
[xnor-lib](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-lib)
[xnor-client](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-client)
[xnor-server](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-server)

it's the same project, just renamed and further development will continue there
I will not accept any pull requests
